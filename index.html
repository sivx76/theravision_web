								<h2>Problem</h2>
								Walking dramatically improves health outcomes and a hospital’s financial performance, but patients don’t walk as much as they should. <br> <br>

								Research from the American Geriatric Society estimates that patients are in bed for about 83% of the hospital stay and spend less than 3% of their time standing or walking. This immobility has dire consequences for patient health: patients stay in the hospital longer, their physical well-being dramatically deteriorates, are more likely to return to the hospital and cost health providers money.

									<h2>Solution: ArtWalk</h2>

									In response to this pressing health and financial issue,Theravision Health Informatics has developed the ArtWalk program to promote inpatient walking, engages staff and optimizes rehabilitation. <b> At the core of the program is Theravision’s iPad-based, Augmented Reality art scavenger system which will motivate patients to walk sooner and more often. </b> Patients walk to ‘collect’ curated art and landmarks on their floors; in doing so this gamification allows them to understand and meet their daily walking goals. <br> <br>

									Think Pokemon Go, meets world-class surgical, physical therapy, ICU, pregnancy and geriatric clinical guidelines. <br> <br>

									We are launching a clinical trial for advanced cancer patients who will be enrolled in our Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) program. When patients walk earlier and more often, their recovery process is improved. <b> Patients randomized into the ArtWalk cohort are expected to have a decreased length of stay (LOS), surgical complications and readmissions. </b>

								<h2>Opportunity</h2>
								The healthcare system is in a state of transformation. New reforms in health system organization and financial mechanisms attempt to achieve the Quadruple Aim of Medicine: increase quality, decrease cost, provide care for populations and decrease clinician burnout.<br> <br>

								We believe digital medicine offers an approach to dramatically optimize health delivery and reach the Quadruple Aim, at scale. Software can be designed to deliver the very best of clinical research and human-centered design to hospitals and clinics across the world - especially to the most vulnerable of patients. <br> <br>

								<b> Our goal is to create a notable technology vendor, that can  heal and delight patients with every step.</b> We aim to develop a therapeutic technology that can automate and scale powerful evidence-based treatments across hundreds of hospitals and clinics.
								We will focus our initial focus on ERAS patients. Research shows all patients can benefit from enhanced mobility - especially physical therapy, ICU, pregnancy and geriatric patients. After this initial feasibility study, will develop custom modules for these clinical populations to supercharge their recovery.
